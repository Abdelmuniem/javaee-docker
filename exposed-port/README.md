# Using Exposed Docker Admin Ports to Deploy Java EE Applications 
As opposed to deploying applications within Docker images, this demo will show an alternative way of deploying Java EE applications on Docker. Application server admin ports will be exposed outside Docker. The application will then be deployed through this admin port or console.

TODO Hillmer will do this part.
