# Auto-Deploying Java EE Applications through Mounted Docker Volumes 
As opposed to deploying applications within Docker images, this demo will show an alternative way of deploying Java EE applications on Docker. Application server auto-deploy directories will point to external Docker mounted volumes. When the files in the mounted volumes change, the server inside Docker will auto-deploy it.

TODO Hillmer will do this part.
