# Effective Docker and Kubernetes for Java EE Developers
This repository shows several key trade-offs to consider while using Docker and Kubernetes with Java EE applications. 

The basic Java EE application used throughout is in the [javaee](/javaee) folder. 

Factors demostrated include:
* Using thin WARs with Docker. The [thin-war](/thin-war) folder shows how this is done.
* Using uber jars with Docker. The [exposed-port](/exposed-port) folder shows how this is done.
* Using hollow uber-jars with Docker. The [hollow-uber-jar](/hollow-uber-jar) folder shows how this is done.
* Deploying applications within Docker images. The [inside-image](/inside-image) folder shows how this is done.
* Deploying applications through admin ports exposed out of Docker. The [exposed-port](/exposed-port) folder shows how this is done.
* Auto-deploying applications through mounted external Docker volumes. The [mounted-volume](/mounted-volume) folder shows how this is done.
* How to make application server administration, clustering, autodiscovery and load-balancing work with Docker clusters, networking, and Kubernetes deployments. The [kubernetes-clustering](/kubernetes-clustering) folder shows how this is done.
* How your CI/CD pipeline looks like with Java EE, Docker and Kubernetes. The [jenkins-kubertenes](/jenkins-kubertenes) folder shows how this is done.
